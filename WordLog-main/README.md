# WordLog : English To Bangla Dictionary

## About

This web application serves as an English to Bangla dictionary and is made using JavaScript. It implements [Perfect hashing](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/static-perfect-hashing) technique which is a model of hashing used for making a hash table with no collisions and performing lookups in constant time. Thus this dictionary can search for any English word and show its Bengali meaning in O(1) time complexity.

(This application is made as an assignment for 'Design & Analysis of Algorithms-II' course.)
